# Bank_Clients_behavior
Another one of my projects is from the Machine Learning field. 
With big excitement, I want to share with you my newest project. Where my main goal was to predict whether a customer will leave the bank soon or not.
Here I worked with many different classifiers and hyperparameters to them, after all, I created a model which gave me 86% of accuracy.
